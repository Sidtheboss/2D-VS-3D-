Features

Synthetic Dataset: Generates 2D slices and 3D volumes for basic geometric shapes (cubes and spheres).

Deep Learning Model: A custom neural network with Conv2D, Conv3DTranspose layers, and UpSampling2D for 2D-to-3D reconstruction.

Visualization: Displays the original 2D slice, the ground truth 3D model, and the predicted 3D model for comparison.

Evaluation: Uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss to measure the model's performance.

Use Cases

Medical Imaging: Reconstruct CT or MRI scans into 3D models for diagnostics.

Engineering: Convert cross-sectional designs into complete 3D models.

Geospatial Applications: Create 3D terrains from 2D maps.

Virtual Reality (VR): Generate 3D objects for immersive applications.

Robotics: Enable robots to infer 3D shapes for object manipulation.

Dataset

Synthetic Data Generation

The dataset simulates:

Cubes: Slices of a 10x10x10 cube.

Spheres: Slices of a sphere with a radius of 4 centered in a 10x10x10 grid.

Each 2D slice corresponds to a position along one axis of the 3D shape.

Model Architecture

The model consists of:

2D Convolutional Layers:

Extract features from 2D slices.

Use Conv2D layers with ReLU activation and MaxPooling2D.

Upsampling Layers:

Upscale the features to match the input size.

3D Layers:

Convert the upsampled 2D features into 3D volumes using Conv3DTranspose.

Use Conv3D with a sigmoid activation to output a 3D volume.
